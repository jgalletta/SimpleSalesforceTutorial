# SimpleSalesforceTutorial
Hello everyone and welcome to my simple-salesforce tutorial for Python noobs

1. If you are a complete Python noob, please follow this guide on how to setup your Python environment: 
    https://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/lab01-installing.html

2. After your environment is setup, we now want to install the simple-salesforce package.  

    Open terminal and run the following command: pip install simple-salesforce

    If that doesn't work, do this: sudo pip install simple-salesforce

3. Load your .py file into your IDE and fill lines 11 and 12 with your credentials of your demo org (between the apostrophes), in order to connect the code to Salesforce

4. Now you are all connected, follow the tutorials, and start messing around in your Salesforce org with Python.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The provided .py file will not alter your org out of the box
